# Auto-Scroller 
A project for automatically scrolling the screen depending on eye position estimation using a Machine Learning approach.

There are two different approaches I used for data gathering: while looking at the mouse pointer press the mouse button to capture your eyes, 
or a loop moving the mouse on its own while the user has to follow it.
