# Auto-Scroller 
A project for automatically scrolling the screen depending on eye position estimation using a Machine Learning approach.

There are two different approaches I used for data gathering: while looking at the mouse pointer press the mouse button to capture your eyes, 
or a loop moving the mouse on its own while the user has to follow it.

Currently still a work in progress, due to the difficulty of collecting enough data for the model to accurately predict the users gaze. The model is still sensitive to head position and angle relative to where it was in the training data
